      <p>“Well here comes the sun, You’re in my arms. my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance that you’ll stay through the night.” – The Weeknd

         <h3> Weeknd’s Music Genre </h3> 
         <p> There’s quite a bit of discussion when it comes to defining The Weeknd’s specific music style..
            The Weeknd’s music is highly influenced by the genre alternative R&B.
            He pairs this with other genres though. For example, his hit song “Earned It” is a mix of a music style termed ‘chamber pop’ and R&B.
            This cross-genre experimentation won him a Grammy in the Best R&B category.
            Pop music also plays a big part in The Weeknd’s style. Pop elements can be heard in many of his songs, like “Can’t Feel My Face”.
            His songs make good use of those easy-to-remember lyrics, a common feature in pop music.            
            The Weeknd also has a liking for Electronic Dance Music.
            It is a genre that features beats meant for dancing, and it can be seen in tracks like “How Do I Make You Love Me?” and “Starboy”. His admiration for Daft Punk can also be felt.</p>

                 <p> When the Weeknd—aka Abel Tesfaye—first arrived, he shrouded himself in mystery. He rarely showed his face and never spoke outside the music that peppered his trilogy of 2011 mixtapes, House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence. That changed, however, when Drake’s co-sign led to his major-label debut, Kiss Land, in 2013. His follow-up, Beauty Behind the Madness, made him a star with singles like “Earned It,” “Can’t Feel My Face,” and “The Hills.” His third album, Starboy, with its title track appearance from Daft Punk, cemented his status as one of the most visible pop stars in the world.</p>
